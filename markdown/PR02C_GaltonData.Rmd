## Setup

### Packages Used

```{r loadpackages}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
```

### Datasets Used

#### Background of the Data

Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin, studied the relationship between parent heights and the heights of their offspring. His pioneering [1886 article](https://galton.org/essays/1880-1889/galton-1886-jaigi-regression-stature.pdf) is the first appearance of regression analysis in print. He originated many statistical terms and concepts, including regression, correlation, deviate, quartile, and percentile, plus median for the midpoint of a distribution. The `galtonheightdata` dataset was [created under the direction of Dr. James A. Hanley](http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/galton/) using Galton's [original paper notebooks](http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/galton/notebook/index.html) containing the measurement data. You can access the `galtonfamiliesmain.csv` and `galtonfamiliessub.csv` datasets from the [description](https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/Datasets/InstructorDescriptions/galtonheightdata.html) page. A third dataset, `galtonfamiliesnotebook.csv`, shows the notebook page on which each family's information was recorded.

#### Galton Main Dataset

```{r loadmaindata}
data_main <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/galtonfamiliesmain.csv")
glimpse(data_main)
```

#### Galton Subset Dataset

```{r loadsubdata}
data_sub <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/galtonfamiliessub.csv")
glimpse(data_sub)
```

#### Galton Notebook Dataset

```{r loadnotebook}
data_notebook <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/galtonfamiliesnotebook.csv")

## Analyses

### Create the Analysis Datasets

#### Dataset #1

Load the three Galton datasets and use `glimpse()` to explore their structures. Refer to Project 1 and use the new data binding/joining skills you have learned to assemble a single dataset that meets the following criteria. Use `glimpse()` and `head()` to display the result. (Hint: Use `bind_rows()` to connect the `main` and `sub` datasets, then use a join to add the `notebook` information.)

* contains these variables:
   * `familyid` = ID number of the family, with `136A` recoded as `205`
   * `page` = the notebook page on which the family is recorded
   * `num_children`= the number of children in the family
   * `father_ht` = the height of the father
   * `mother_ht` = the "transmuted" (per Galton) height of the mother
   * `midparent` = the average of the parents' heights (using transmuted mother)
   * `child_sex`= whether the child is a son or a daughter, in all lower case
   * `child_ht` = the height of the child with daughter heights "transmuted"
   
* is arranged according to:
   * ascending order of familyid
   * sons before daughters within family
   * in order of height within each sex of child

```{r assembledata1}
#mutate/select from `data_main` to create needed and remove unnecessary variables
data_main <- data_main %>%
  mutate(familyID = as.numeric(ifelse(FamilyID == "136A", 205, FamilyID)),
         mother_ht = 1.08 * Mother,
         child_ht = if_else(Child == 'Daughter',  1.08 * Height,  Height),
         midparent = ((mother_ht + Father)/2)
         ) %>%
  select(familyid = familyID,
         num_children = Children,
         father_ht = Father,
         mother_ht,
         midparent,
         child_sex = Child,
         child_ht,
         )

#mutate/select from `data_sub` to create needed and remove unnecessary variables
data_sub <- data_sub %>%
  mutate(
    father_ht = FatherR + 60,
    mother = MotherR + 60,
    height = HeightR + 60,
    mother_ht = 1.08 * mother,
    child_ht = if_else(Child == 'Daughter',  1.08 * height,  height),
    midparent = ((mother_ht + father_ht)/2)
  ) %>%
   select(familyid = FamilyID,
         num_children = Children,
         father_ht,
         mother_ht,
         midparent,
         child_sex = Child,
         child_ht
         )

#mutate data_notebook to correct `familyID` `136A` to `205` and make numeric
data_notebook <- data_notebook %>%
  mutate(familyID = as.numeric(ifelse(FamilyID == "136A", 205, FamilyID)))

#use bind_rows to create dataframe `assembled_data1` including `data_main` and `data_sub`
assembled_data1 <- bind_rows(data_main, data_sub)

#makes observations in `child_sex` all lowercase
assembled_data1$child_sex <- tolower(assembled_data1$child_sex)

#joins `data_notebook` to `assembled_data1` using `familyid`, selects the needed variables in the correct order, arranges by `familyid`, `child_sex`, and `child_ht`
assembled_data1 <- assembled_data1 %>%
  inner_join(data_notebook, by = c("familyid" = "familyID")) %>%
  select(
    familyid,
    page = Page,
    num_children,
    father_ht,
    mother_ht,
    midparent,
    child_sex,
    child_ht
  ) %>%
  arrange(
    familyid,
    desc(child_sex),
    desc(child_ht)
  )

#displays resulting dataframe
glimpse(assembled_data1)
head(assembled_data1)
```

#### Dataset #2

From Dataset #1, select the variables `familyid` and `num_children`, then reduce the dataset so it contains only one unique row per family. Use `glimpse()` to display the result. (Hint: The final dataset should have 205 rows/observations and two variables/columns.)

```{r assembledata2}
assembled_data2 <- assembled_data1 %>%
  select(familyid,
         num_children
  )  %>%
  distinct()
glimpse(assembled_data2)
```

### Visualization 1: Updated Scatterplot

#### Galton's Visualization

In his original paper (linked above), Galton created several tables and diagrams. His "Diagram Based on Table 1" of them is similar in concept to a scatterplot. Rather than dots, he grouped/tabulated the data, and then used the count of how many people were grouped at the coordinate pairs in his grid, with child as the x-axis and mid-parent as the y-axis. There are two scales: inches and deviations from 68.25 inches.

```{r galtonscatterplot, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "../images/galtonplot.png")
```

#### Your Data Visualization

**This plot uses Dataset #1.**

Create a scatterplot of child height (x-axis) versus mid-parent height (y-axis). Ordinarily, we might reverse the axes here because analysts would be more likely to model child height as a function of parent height, but we want to be able to compare the updated plot to Galton's original.

Include the following.

* make your dots larger than the default size to help show density
* set transparency to adjust for overplotting and help show density
* use `color =` in the `aes` to differentiate sons versus daughters
* use `scale_color_manual()` to choose two colorblind-safe colors
* scale both axes so that there is a tick mark at every whole inch
* use `coord_fixed()` so that the axes have the same unit spacing
* add better x- and y-axis labels, including the units of measure
* add an informative title (you may optionally include a subtitle)
* add `color =` to `labs()` to set the legend title to `"gender of child"` 
* use a built-in theme (e.g., `theme_linedraw()`) to add formatting
* use `theme()` to move the legend to the bottom of the scatterplot

```{r updatedscatterplot}
assembled_data1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = child_ht, y = midparent, color = child_sex)) + #sets x/y axes and colors points based on 'child_sex'
  geom_point(size = 1.5, alpha = 0.4) + #creates scatterplot with larger point size and transparent points
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#DC3220",
                                "#005AB5")) + #colorblind friendly hex codes sourced from davidmathlogic.com
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 22), limits = c(60, 79)) + #sets x axis limits and creates breaks at every whole inch
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 14), limits = c(64, 74)) + #sets y axis limits and creates breaks at every whole inch
  coord_fixed() + #axes have same unit spacing
  labs(title = "Child Height Compared to Mid-Parent Height", subtitle = "Differentiated for Child Sex", x = "Child Height in Inches", y = "Averaged Parent Height in Inches", color = "Gender of Child") + #sets labels
  theme_grey() + #built-in theme
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") #moves legend below the plot
```

### Visualization 2: Number of Children

**This plot uses Dataset #2.**

Create a barplot to show the distribution of the number of children per family. Set the bars to something other than the default `width`. Scale the x-axis so that there is a tick mark for each bar. Choose appropriate colors, labels, themes, and/or and other types of formatting that you feel will enhance the meaning or visual appearance of the plot.  (Hint: Use `count()` to find out how many families have a given number of children, then use that information to create your plot.)

```{r childrenbarplot}
childrenbardata <- assembled_data2 %>% #creating a new dataframe with `num_children` and counts of how many families have each value in `num_children`, saved as `num_families`
  count(num_children) %>%
  select(num_children,
         num_families = n)

childrenbardata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = num_children, y = num_families)) + #creates a barplot of distribution of family size from new dataframe
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.8, fill = "#005AB5") + #sets the width and fill of the bars
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 16)) + #sets x-axis ticks to one per family size
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 7)) + #sets y-axis ticks to be easier to read
  labs(title = "Distribution of Family Sizes by Number of Children", x = "Number of Children", y = "Number of Families") + #sets labels
  theme_grey() #built-in theme consistent with previous plot
  
```

## Questions

**Question 1:** Do you think your scatterplot is an improvement over Galton's original diagram? Are there any other modifications and/or additions you would make to enhance the clarity or usefulness of your plot?

**ANSWER**

I think my scatterplot is an improvement over Galton's original diagram, as it feels more intuitive to read and includes fewer extraneous variables (eg. deviations). I might add linear regressions to the plot (one for daughter and one for son) to communicate how average child height increases with average midparent height more effectively.

**Question 2:** Explain the rationale behind the choices you made when creating your scatterplot and barplot, such as size, color, transparency, or other features. What motivated your decisions? 

**ANSWER**

I experimented with the size and transparency of the points in my scatterplot, and decided on the parameters I chose because I felt it made the plot easiest to read. I chose the colors of both my plots based on pairs of colorblindness friendly hex codes I found on [this website](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23D81B60-%231E88E5-%23FFC107-%23004D40) and tried to choose colors that would be distinct for all viewers. I chose to use one of the same colors from the scatterplot in the barplot in order to keep the document consistent. 

**Question 3:** Considering best practices, how does using `coord_fixed()` enhance the authenticity of the information shown in the scatterplot, such as the relationship and spread of the data?

**ANSWER**

After testing my plot with and without the addition of `coord_fixed()`, I found that using `coord_fixed()` made the spread of the data more accurate.
