**Work Plan/Assignments**

I plan to work through the project components in order, starting with #02A, then #02B, and finishing with #02C.

**Completion Timeline**

I plan to complete #02A on Friday April 1st, begin working on #02B that weekend, to be completed by Monday April 4th. I plan to use my remaining time for the project on #02C, I hope to complete it by Thursday April 8th in order to give myself time to troubleshoot over the weekend.

**Communication Plan**

I am completing this project on my own, so I will not need to have a communication plan with others. If I encounter any issues, I will reach out to Dr. Thomley via the private forum or attend office hours.
